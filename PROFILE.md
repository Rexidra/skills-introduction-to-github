# Remco Stroop

### About Me
I'm a **21-year-old entrepreneur** from the Netherlands. Passionate about coding, business, and technology, I am focused on building scalable solutions and tools for productivity and automation. My goal is to develop groundbreaking projects while continuously improving my skills.

### What You'll Find Here
- **Learning Journey**: Repositories documenting my ongoing learning of different tech stacks. I'm building projects to improve my skills in areas like **Rust**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, and more.
- **Practice Projects**: Small, focused projects built to deepen my understanding of specific technologies and frameworks.
- **Templates**: Repositories of templates, code snippets, and configurations that I use in my day-to-day work, which may be helpful for others.
- **Ideas & Prototypes**: Projects that focus on rapid prototyping of new concepts and technologies I am exploring.
- **Tools & Utilities**: Custom utilities, scripts, and mini-projects created to streamline my workflow or solve specific challenges.

### What to Expect
This profile showcases my personal growth as a developer, with each repository documenting my journey through different learning phases. You can expect:
- **Tech Stack Exploration**: Repositories dedicated to mastering specific technologies such as **Rust**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and more. Each one serves as a detailed, hands-on example of working with these technologies.
- **Project Documentation**: Insightful documentation for every project I work on, including challenges faced, solutions, lessons learned, and future enhancements.
- **Templates & Code Snippets**: Useful templates for common tasks in programming (e.g., authentication systems, API integrations, project structures), and reusable code snippets that make development faster and easier.
- **Experimentation with New Tools**: As I explore new technologies, you'll find experimental projects that demonstrate how to work with cutting-edge tools, libraries, and frameworks.
- **Learning Milestones**: Detailed logs of my progression as a developer, highlighting significant achievements, learning breakthroughs, and challenges overcome. Youâ€™ll also find examples of practical implementations for each technology stack I master.
- **Collaborations**: Repositories for open-source projects and collaborations with other developers. Feel free to contribute or open issues for improvement!

### Learning Progress
- I am following a structured learning path that spans across 12-week programs to build proficiency in a wide range of technologies. This allows me to continuously learn, iterate, and improve. Repositories will reflect my learning phases, with detailed logs about each milestone and the projects I create during that time.
- As part of my learning process, I focus on building **real-world applications** and **open-source contributions** that allow me to apply the knowledge I gain in meaningful ways.
- Learning is not just about theory for me; I aim to build projects that can potentially evolve into production-ready applications, testing my understanding in real scenarios.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, Rust, Ruby on Rails  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GitHub Actions, Nginx  
- **Security**: OAuth2/JWT, Bcrypt

### Secrets (Upcoming TECH Giant)
I am building something exciting which is a **Huge Upcoming Tech Giant** designed to streamline and automate business operations (In a very special way). While it's still under development, expect the idea of simplifying workflows and enhancing productivity, to save time. And much more! all through an easy-to-use interface. Stay tuned for more as I continue to work on this project over the next few years!
